        <div id="in7uk9" class="gpd-text"><strong><em>"Until I understand where I am, I can’t get to where I am going. This is the value of a compass when we are out walking or hiking and need to know we’re going in the right direction. But we also have an internal North Star. It’s that little nudge that tells us if we are on the right path to fulfilling our potential, or on the wrong path wasting energy traveling somewhere we don’t need to go. So my advice to you is, pull out that compass every once in a while and make sure you are navigating in the right direction on your journey."</em></strong>
            <br><em>~ John C. Maxwell.</em></div>
        <h1 id="i8l9wm"><strong>Your brand is your soul expressed symbolically.</strong></h1>
        <h1 id="i7183m" style="font-family:'Playfair Display';"><strong><em>ad stellam polarem</em> (Latin): "Toward the north star."</strong>​​​​​​​</h1>
        <div id="i92b1k"><strong>​​​​​​​<br></strong><span style="color:null"><em>"Justice is like the north star, which is fixed, and all the rest revolve about it." ~ Confucius.<br></em></span>
            <br>
            <br><span style="color:null"><em>​​​​​​​"Hold fast to the Truth, for the Truth is a pillar; a steadfast pillar that all the world cannot shake. Not by the breadth of an hair has it moved since time's dawning, nor yet by the breadth of an hair until time have its end. From the uttermost height of the Heaven descendeth the pillar; descendeth it down as a glorious pillar of Light." ~ The Clear Recital.<br>​​​​​​​<br></em></span>
            <br><span style="color:null"><em>"There are gonna be a core set of values that shouldn't be up for debate. Should be our north star." ~ President Barack Obama.<br></em></span>
            <p><span style="color:null"><em>​​​​​​​</em></span>Too often, as a solopreneur or a shopkeeper, your brand may be mere afterthoughts and honestly, I can't blame you. There are thousands of tasks each day that you must attend to.
                <br>
                <br>Maybe you're here because you're looking for a quick-and-easy fix. You may be thinking, "I need a logo." I'm sorry to spoil your day, but a "logo" is not your brand. I would go so far as to say that, as a small business, you will be better off without a silly-looking "logo" anyone can whip up on a whim (or with a so-called "free online logo generator," ick).
                <br>
                <br>There is an overload of information online when it comes to branding your small business. There are too many self-styled "online marketing experts" and "business gurus" offering misleading and self-contradictory advice to get you to buy their ware. Unfortunately, almost everything you read about branding is obsolete, misleading, or plain wrong.
                <br>
                <br><strong>ADSTELLAM</strong> believes that a brand is an outward expression of your inward values. As a national flag is a crystallization of a country's culture, history, values, and aspirations, the brand symbolizes your "Big Why" as well as being a touchstone of specific customer experiences.
                <br>Imaginative and intelligent, <strong>ADSTELLAM</strong> sees the big picture behind your brand and yet is obsessively detail-oriented.
                <br>
                <br><strong>ADSTELLAM</strong>'s process-oriented approach to brand development begins and ends with the exploration of your core values and aspiration for the highest degree of ethical and social consciousness. Amidst the sea of ersatz consumer brands and their mindless imitators, <strong>ADSTELLAM</strong> raises the standard of excellence in small business and personal branding.
                <br>
                <br>With <strong>ADSTELLAM</strong>, you will get more than most creative agencies or business consultants normally offer (at a small fraction of the price they charge); you will discover your soul and learn how to package your soul's message to the world through your brand.</p>

                        <div class="feature3-desc">Formerly Limeadestand Works, ADSTELLAM was founded in 2016 as technical assistance and educational service for aspiring and new entrepreneurs. The seeds of what is today's ADSTELLAM, however, were sown in the spring of 2011 as part of a community organizing project at <a data-cke-saved-href="https://archive.is/UpsbO" target="_blank" href="https://archive.is/UpsbO"><span style="color:#540425;">Dorothy Day Community School</span></a> of <a data-cke-saved-href="https://sistersoftheroad.org" target="_blank" href="https://sistersoftheroad.org"><span style="color:#540425;">Sisters Of The Road</span></a> in Portland, Oregon.
                            <br>
                            <br>Originally conceived as a project to build community resiliency among the low-income and houseless people through solidarity economy and microenterprise, the idea was independently revived in 2015 as a practical alternative to anti-poverty activism.
                            <br>
                            <br>Over time, Limeadestand Works have branched out to too many side projects and lost its brand focus and cohesion. In July 2019, Limeadestand Works began a process of refining its brand. This journey ultimately took Limeadestand Works to become ADSTELLAM, now focusing solely on brand development.
                            <br>
                            <br>ADSTELLAM is based in the majestic Pacific Northwest, on the ancestral land of the Tsinuk, Stl'pulmsh, Clatskanie, and Atfalati nations, better known as the metropolitan Portland region.

                            <br>
                            <br>As long as I can remember, I've been creating freedom with my own hands and brain. I've never been a popular kid or an overachiever. Rather, I have always been an outcast, a marginalized outsider looking in, a stranger in a strange land. (My childhood nickname was "E.T.") I grew up with a strong DIY ethos as a matter of survival. To keep my sanity, I've published my own newspapers and even had a tiny underground radio station--years before I discovered the Internet.
                            <br>
                            <br>Since the early days of my life, I've always been a keen observer of media, advertising, propaganda, and brands. In my adolescence, I developed an interest in graphic design. I studied fine art and journalism, making me an adept at pictures and words alike.
                            <br>
                            <br>I survived at the intersections of challenging life circumstances and developed a keen sense of justice and solidarity with the underdogs, misunderstood, and forgotten. I learned to smell bullshit from ten miles away.
                            <br>
                            <br>Having to create opportunities for myself where none existed, I became not only an entrepreneur but also I live every aspect of my life with an entrepreneurial mindset. I have also learned how powerful it is to master the perceptions and words because oppressions and injustice are often perpetuated and exacerbated by certain forms of social conditioning.
                            <br>
                            <br>I am also a <a href="https://www.willowlovestheology.com" target="_blank"  style="color:#fff;" title="Willow Loves Thexlogy!">theologian</a>, minister, and <a href="https://www.mindgeographic.xyz" target="_blank"  style="color:#fff;" title="Mind Geographic">interfaith spiritual direction consultant</a>.

                    <br>ADSTELLAM wishes to acknowledge this land on which we operate. For thousands of years it has been the traditional land of the Tsinuk (Chinook), Clatskanie, Atfalati (Tualatin), and Stl'pulmsh (Cowlitz) nations. Today, this place is still the home to many indigenous people from across Turtle Island and we are grateful to have the opportunity to work on this land.
